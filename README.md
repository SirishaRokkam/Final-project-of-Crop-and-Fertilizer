# Week-1
Project Title: Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

Overview: This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based recommendation system for crops and fertilizers. The goal is to assist farmers in selecting the appropriate crops to plant and the necessary fertilizers based on various environmental and soil parameters.

##Key Features:

Data Analysis: Utilized a dataset containing information on different crops, their nutrient requirements, and environmental conditions.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented various machine learning algorithms to predict the best crop and fertilizer combinations.
Data Visualization: Employed libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data trends and insights.
User -Friendly Interface: Designed a simple interface for users to input their soil and environmental data to receive crop and fertilizer recommendations.

##Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn)
Dataset: The project uses a comprehensive dataset that includes features such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and crop labels.

Conclusion: This project aims to enhance agricultural productivity by providing data-driven insights for crop selection and fertilization, ultimately contributing to sustainable farming practices.
