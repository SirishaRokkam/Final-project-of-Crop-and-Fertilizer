# Week-2
 ### Crop and Fertilizerand Recommendation Prediction System ðŸŒ±
Overview
This project aims to assist farmers by recommending the best crops based on soil and weather conditions and suggesting suitable fertilizers to enhance productivity. Using machine learning models, we analyze key factors such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to provide accurate predictions.

Step-by-Step Process
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
Loaded crop recommendation and fertilizer prediction datasets.
Cleaned data by handling missing values and duplicates.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends.
2. Feature Engineering & Selection
Selected important features: (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall).
Normalized data for better model performance.
3. Model Selection & Training
Used Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM, and KNN for crop recommendation.
Implemented Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes for fertilizer prediction.
Trained models on cleaned data and optimized hyperparameters.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Compared different models and selected the best one for deployment.
5. Deployment (Optional)
Built a simple web interface using Flask/Django.
Created an input form where users can enter soil/weather conditions.
Displayed crop and fertilizer recommendations.
Usage
To predict the best crop:

python
Copy
Edit
python crop_prediction.py
To predict fertilizer recommendations:

python
Copy
Edit
python fertilizer_prediction.py
Results
Achieved high accuracy for crop recommendation and fertilizer prediction.
Provided real-time insights for farmers.
Future Enhancements ðŸš€
Integrate a real-time weather API.
Add GIS-based soil mapping for more accurate predictions.
Improve UI with React.js or Streamlit.
