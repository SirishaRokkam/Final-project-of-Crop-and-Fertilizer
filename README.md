# FINAL PROJECT
 ### Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System üå±
 
## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based recommendation system for crops and fertilizers. The goal is to assist farmers in selecting the appropriate crops to plant and the necessary fertilizers based on various environmental and soil parameters.

## Features
‚úÖ Predicts the best crop based on soil and climate conditions.

‚úÖ Suggests the most suitable fertilizer for better yield.

‚úÖ Data-driven recommendations using machine learning.

‚úÖ Web-based UI for easy interaction.

## Dataset
Crop Recommendation Dataset (Crop_recommendation.csv)

Contains soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall data.

Fertilizer Prediction Dataset (Fertilizer Prediction.csv)

Includes soil nutrient levels and recommended fertilizers.

## Key Features

Data Analysis: Utilized a dataset containing information on different crops, their nutrient requirements, and environmental conditions. Machine Learning Models: Implemented various machine learning algorithms to predict the best crop and fertilizer combinations.

Data Visualization: Employed libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data trends and insights. User -Friendly Interface: Designed a simple interface for users to input their soil and environmental data to receive crop and fertilizer recommendations.

## Technologies Used

Python Pandas NumPy Matplotlib Seaborn Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn) 

Dataset: The project uses a comprehensive dataset that includes features such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and crop labels.

## Conclusion
This project aims to enhance agricultural productivity by providing data-driven insights for crop selection and fertilization, ultimately contributing to sustainable farming practices.
